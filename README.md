# Wifitify

Track WiFi-activity of your devices and trigger actions if devices enter or leave your network.

Some ISPs provide you with their own custom routers, which offer very little features in terms of customizability. \
Wifitify is designed to enable hook-based events for when you cannot root your own router.


## Installation

Check the `docs/Setup.md` document, there's a whole lot of info on how to set this up.
